# About OnlineFinder

OnlineFinder is a [metasearch engine], aggregating the results of other
{{link('search engines', 'preferences')}} while not storing information about
its users.

## Why use it?

- OnlineFinder doesn't generate a profile about you.
- When we scrape from engines like Google, we block your identity.
- We doesn't care about what you search for.
- We never shares anything with a third-party, and it can't be used to compromise you.
- OnlineFinder is a free metasearch engine.

If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise believe
in digital freedom, make OnlineFinder your default search engine or run it on your
own server!

## How do I set it as the default search engine?

OnlineFinder supports [OpenSearch].  For more information on changing your default
search engine, see your browser's documentation:

- [Firefox]
- [Microsoft Edge] - Behind the link, you will also find some useful instructions
  for Chrome and Safari.
- [Chromium]-based browsers only add websites that the user navigates to without
  a path.

## How does it work?

OnlineFinder is a fork from the well-known [searx] [metasearch engine] which was
inspired by the [Seeks project].  It provides basic privacy by mixing your
queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data.  OnlineFinder
can be added to your browser's search bar; moreover, it can be set as the
default search engine.

## History of OnlineFinder

OnlineFinder was established in 1996 as one of the very first search portals on the 
internet. The original goal was to have a place for people and businesses to find things
and people online, interact with listings containing contact information and website links.
Later OnlineFinder started provideing free email and free websites. 

When Google first started, they contacted us asking us to use their code but we declined.
During a 24 hour lapse, a cyber-squatter purchased our .net domain and shortly after we
found that our email and sites were being blocked by major corporatoins, including Google;
because we offered those services for free. 

Nowadays, we compile ALL of the search engines under our name, free for you to use.
You can turn on or off any search engine to scan in the preferences for your searches.

100% Private searches! Tons of search engines all under one search page! Easy to use!
