# About OnlineFinder

OnlineFinder is a metasearch engine, aggregating the results of other search engines 
while not storing information about its users. We let you use other search engines without
having to give them your digital history and identity.

## How does it work?
When you use OnlineFinder to search the internet, we collect information from places
like google, bing, wikipedia, etc... and then sort and present it to you. Those websites
think OnlineFinder is the one doing the searches, not you. You leave no fingerprint behind,
no advertising tracking, and no concerns about your searches being monitored by us
or by the search engines we scrape for you.

## How secure is it?
The only information stored is on your own browser, not our server. It's a cookie to set 
your preferences of background color and other features in the preferences section. If you
clear your cookies then you will need to choose your preferences again for the heavy-duty
preferences options.

## Why use it?

- OnlineFinder doesn't generate a profile about you.
- We are like an identity firewall protecting you from search engines.
- When we scrape from engines like Google, we block your identity.
- We doesn't care about what you search for.
- We never share anything with a third-party, and it can't be used to compromise you.
- OnlineFinder is a free metasearch engine.

If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise believe
in digital freedom, make OnlineFinder your default search engine or run it on your
own server!

## How do I set it as the default search engine?

OnlineFinder supports [OpenSearch].  For more information on changing your default
search engine, see your browser's documentation:

- [Firefox]
- [Microsoft Edge] - Behind the link, you will also find some useful instructions
  for Chrome and Safari.
- [Chromium]-based browsers only add websites that the user navigates to without
  a path.


## History of OnlineFinder

OnlineFinder was established in 1996 as one of the very first search portals on the 
internet. Nowadays, we compile a vast amount of the search engines under one page, 
free for you to use. OnlineFinder is currently a fork of SearXNG. You can turn on or off any 
search engine to scan in the preferences for your searches.

100% Private searches! Tons of search engines all under one search page! Easy to use!
