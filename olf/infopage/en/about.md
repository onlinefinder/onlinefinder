# About OnlineFinder

OnlineFinder is a metasearch engine, aggregating the results of other {{link('search engines', 'preferences')}} while not storing information about its users. We let you use other search engines without having to give them your digital history and identity.

## How does it work?

When you use OnlineFinder to search the internet, we collect information from places like google, bing, wikipedia, etc… and then sort and present it to you. Those websites think OnlineFinder is the one doing the searches, not you. You leave no fingerprint behind, no advertising tracking, and no concerns about your searches being monitored by us or by the search engines we scrape for you.

## How secure is it?

The only information stored is on your own browser, not our server. It's a cookie to set your preferences of background color and other features in the preferences section. If you clear your cookies then you will need to choose your preferences again for the heavy-duty preferences options.

## Why use it?

- OnlineFinder doesn't generate a profile about you.
- We are like an identity firewall protecting you from search engines.
- When we scrape from engines like Google, we block your identity.
- We don't care about what you search for.
- We never share anything with a third-party, and it can't be used to compromise you.
- OnlineFinder is a free metasearch engine.

If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise believe in digital freedom, make OnlineFinder your default search engine. OnlineFinder supports [OpenSearch]. For more information on changing your default search engine, see your browser documentation.
